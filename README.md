# 🧬 Quantum-Inspired DNA Cryptography 

Welcome to the crossroads of biology, quantum theory, and cryptography!  

This MATLAB GUI project encrypts and decrypts your data using LFSR-generated keys, DNA sequences, and quantum-inspired tricks.


###  Key Features:
- Generates pseudo-random binary keys with LFSR  🔑 
- Encodes them into synthetic DNA (A, T, G, C)
- Adds quantum-inspired randomness (superposition + entanglement)
- 🔐 Encrypts + Decrypts
- Tests security with entropy and avalanche effect analysis 🧪
  
Secure, lightweight, and bio-inspired encryption is the future

💡 **Fun Fact:** 1 bit change in the key can flip over 50% of the output — now that’s cryptographic chaos!
